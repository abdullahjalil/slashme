# Third-Person 3D Game in Python

![Game Screenshot](screenshot.png) *(Note: You'll need to add your own screenshot)*

## Description

This is a simple 3D third-person game built with Python using Pygame and ModernGL. The player can move around in a 3D environment using WASD keys and control the camera view with mouse movement.

## Features

- Third-person camera that follows the player
- WASD movement controls
- Mouse look for camera rotation
- Simple 3D environment with a ground plane and obstacles
- Efficient rendering using ModernGL
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Pygame
- ModernGL
- NumPy
- pyrr

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/third-person-python-game.git
   cd third-person-python-game
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install them manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame moderngl numpy pyrr
   ```

## How to Run

Execute the game with:
```bash
python third_person_game.py
```

- **W**: Move forward
- **A**: Move left
- **S**: Move backward
- **D**: Move right
- **Mouse Movement**: Look around

## Extending the Game

This project serves as a foundation that you can build upon. Here are some ideas for enhancements:

1. **Add textures**: Replace the colored faces with actual textures
2. **Implement collisions**: Add proper collision detection with obstacles
3. **Add lighting**: Implement directional or point lighting
4. **Include more models**: Add more complex 3D objects
5. **Add game mechanics**: Implement jumping, running, or object interaction
